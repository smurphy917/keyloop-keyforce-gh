 - for each root line (required by is false) 
    - Gather root asset ids
    - Where null, gather orderitem id (bundle root)

 - for each root asset id
    - if null, for each bundle root
        generate BOM from order items
    - else:
        generate BOM from asset, merge in order items
            flag lines on current order, to be handled later
    
    - roll-up values
        - for each touched asset/line, calc total and flag parent for recalc; recurse
    - aggregate:
        for node.bottomUp() (assets)
            - if has aggregate, retrieve and merge
                - "has" can mean already staged for another asset
                    - check for staged request by id (if present on node[asset]) or by 
            - else create and link
    - loop over node.all(), for each:
        - create asset task:
            - generate/change/cancel
            - add post hook -> save response details (id) back to node
            - add to queue

 - add final task:
    - for each root asset id:
        - loop over node.all(), for each:
            - set parent
            - set order lookup




 - fetch all assets and orderitems
 - add as needed
 - update as needed
 - at end find all that need inserting and create tasks
